				<p class="title"> The Crystal Goblet</p>

				<div class="text_box">
					<p> In 1932, Beatrice Warde explained with beautiful metaphors that good typography should be invisible in order to convey its meaning. She gives the example of a Crystal goblet, holding fine wine, an ideal vessel allowing us to visually see the wine’s virtues. To her, text should be like fine wine, and the typography is the vessel that contains it. In order to reveal content that is within, there must be a humble use of typography to serve the text instead of ornamentation.</p>

				<p class="title"> Design as Art</p>

				<div class="text_box">
					<p> In 1966, Bruno Murari inspired us with a new idea in his book ‘Design as Art’. The designer of today is the one who tries to establish a connection between art and the general public, he humbly responds to the needs of the common man. The designer is the visual communicator. They work while keeping in mind printing techniques and psychological functions- Form follows the function. The two go hand in hand in order to visually communicate design and content.</p>

				<div class="text_box">
					<p> Knowing your Design History is Crucial to Aesthetic Innovation written in 2022 uses the examples from the last 40 years in order to illuminate that design must be linked to its context for it to be considered good. Without context, design can be misinterpreted and its purpose is removed from its meaning. The past is constantly resurfacing in the future and plays an important role in creating new design styles. When designing, one can borrow from historial styles and give another depth of meaning through the social and cultural context.</p>

				<div>
					<p class="text_box">As time went by and we moved from print to digital, we must forgo the misleading idea that substance and presentation exist on separate layers. Without typography, a text has no visual characteristics, a goblet can be invisible as its wine has a form. Whereas, text is already invisible, hence, typography cannot be. Form does follow function, but the two go hand in hand in order to effectively communicate ideas across. An integral part of design is the cycling of styles that come and go and the ability to communicate iconic ideas of history to aesthetically innovate today. “The burden remains on us to translate the past to be good innovators”.</p>

				<div>
					<p class="text_box">The main function of typography is to portray the function of the text, but it also must have its own form, and that form should be seen in the backdrop of the context in order to truly absorb the intentions of the designer.</p>
