                    <p>In any form of Design, styles come and go. Knowing what has been done and worked as well as what didn’t work will help determine what the future of design could be. We can use the past to decode the present and forecast a stylistic future. Design must be linked to its context for it to be considered good. Without context, design is an embarrassment. If you borrow from a historical style, it is important to learn where that style came from, its social and cultural contexts that led to its rise. </p>

                    <p>In the late 1910s and early 1920s, Constructivism grew out of a Soviet State sponsored movement designed to disseminate political doctrine. Collectivism, universality, practicality, industry, and purity evoked the new Soviet utopia, yielding a simplified red, black, and white Communist palette.</p>

                    <p>Featuring intoxicating thick red and black stripes, primary shapes, and images that comprised a universal language engaging an illiterate peasant population.

                    <p>Studio Number One’s advertising campaign for the luxury department store copied it verbatim. English language messages were written in geometric, Cyrillic-inspired letterforms to connote Russian typography. The campaign’s black and white photography mimics that of Alexander Rodchenko’s photos of spirited Communist youths gazing toward an idealized future.  </p>

                    <p>At first glance, seeing a high-end retailer like Saks appropriate the Constructivist methodology to sell high fashion to their beau monde clientele was a complete assault on the original Soviet mission—it felt completely out of context. And indeed, fetishism and revival can be dangerous when it decontextualizes a style from its social or political origin. Yet upon closer examination, Want It theoretically stoked the 2008 recession-era economy. Studio Number One hijacked the Constructivist ethos to fire up a patriotic faith through unmitigated stylistic quotation. In many ways, Studio Number One outsmarted the market with a posture that lower forms of imitation failed to assume. Despite the nearly hundred years separating the Constructivist and Studio Number One campaigns, a repeat performance of art and politics converge, the context presented itself once again. Studio Number One consciously hopscotched the Great Wheel of Style, landing squarely back at the cradle of good design. </p>
